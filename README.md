This is an example of using [Purdue Hackers ID](https://github.com/purduehackers/id) as a custom provider for NextAuth/Auth.js, which allows for easily adding "Sign In with ID" to your website.

See `auth.ts` for the implementation of the custom provider and `types.ts` for custom typings for the custom provider.
